# Ray
Simple backlight management tool.

# Do not use this if you're not prepared to galaxy to explode
This is still in heavily in WIP and there is still a possibility it will brick your laptop. So don't use if you're not prepared to lose some hardware.

# Why `ray`
I used to use backlight control tool named [light](https://github.com/haikarainen/light) from `haikarainen`, but it seems to be so that he has dropped now support for it and is archived. I wanted to find similar simple tool, but there wasn't anything that ticked to marks for me. So I stated writing my own.
